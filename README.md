# Flipkart MERN Stack Clone

This repository contains a full–stack e‑commerce web application inspired by Flipkart, built using the **MERN** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack.  It demonstrates how to implement a modern online store with user authentication, product management, order processing and an admin dashboard.

## Key Features

- **User Account Management:** Users can register, log in, update their profile and change their password.  Authentication is handled via JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).  Admins can view, update and delete users:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
- **Product Browsing:** Products are loaded from MongoDB with pagination (12 items per page), search and optional filtering by category, rating and price range.  Detailed product pages display images, descriptions, pricing, stock status and customer reviews:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
- **Shopping Cart & Wishlist:** Shoppers can add items to a cart, adjust quantities and remove items.  (A wishlist feature can be added similarly.):contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
- **Checkout Process:** The app captures shipping information, allows selection of payment method (e.g., PayPal or cash on delivery) and computes order totals (items, tax, shipping and final amount).  Orders are saved to the database and confirmation emails can be integrated:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.
- **Order Management:** Users can view their order history and details (payment/delivery status).  Admins can view all orders and update delivery status:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.
- **Reviews:** Authenticated users can leave reviews on products with a rating and comment.  Reviews contribute to a product’s overall rating:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Admins have a dashboard summarizing total users, products, orders and sales.  They can manage products (create, update, delete), orders and users through dedicated management pages:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your system
- **MongoDB** server (local or cloud) with a valid connection string

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd flipkart-mern/backend
Install dependencies:

npm install
Create a .env file based on .env.example and set the following variables:

env
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
PORT=5000
Start the backend server:


npm run dev
The API will run on http://localhost:5000/.

Frontend Setup
In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory:


cd flipkart-mern/frontend
Install dependencies:


npm install
Start the React development server:


npm start
The app will be served on http://localhost:3000/ and proxy API requests to the backend.

Build for Production
To build the frontend for production, run npm run build in the frontend folder. Deploy the contents of frontend/dist along with the backend on a server of your choice.

Extending the Project
This project provides a solid foundation for an online store. Possible extensions include:

Integrating a real payment gateway (e.g., Paytm, Stripe, Razorpay)

Implementing a wishlist or “save for later” feature
